# Windows 10-styled twemoji folder/library icons
I created this couple of batches after became infuriated by a deviantart guy trying to sold them.

You will need:
- On Bash:
  * librsvg;
  * Imagemagick 6
- On Windows:
  * Inkscape (optionally on PATH; you can add it only for the .BATs - change the inkscape path on both BATs!);
  * Imagemagick 7 (should be on your PATH);
- [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) repository cloned on your computer.

The base library icon is from [VCFerreira](https://www.deviantart.com/vcferreira/art/Windows-10-Library-Base-png-and-ico-536899477), and the folder icon bases are made by Microsoft (from imageres.dll).
