# Windows 10-styled twemoji folder/library icons
I created this couple of batches after became infuriated by a deviantart guy trying to sold them.

You will need:
  * Inkscape (optionally on PATH; you can add it only for the .BATs - change the inkscape path on both BATs!);
  * Imagemagick (should be on your PATH);

And yeah its poorly written but its my first public project anyway.

And again open the scripts before running!
	
	
The base library icon is from [VCFerreira](https://www.deviantart.com/vcferreira/art/Windows-10-Library-Base-png-and-ico-536899477), and the folder icon bases are made by Microsoft (from imageres.dll).

Both should be used with a original Windows 10 and *only for personal use*.
